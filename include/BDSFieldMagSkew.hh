/**
 * @brief A wrapper class for BDSFieldMag that rotates it.
 * 
 * This is a wrapper class for a BDSFieldMag instance that rotates it by applying
 * a rotation to the coordinates before querying the wrapped field object.
 * This is intended to implement skew fields but any arbritary rotation can
 * be applied, although this should be considered carefully.
 * 
 * This class owns the field and rotation matrix.
